# Chladni Frequency Visualizer

This project is a Chladni Frequency Visualizer built with plain HTML/JavaScript. It demonstrates the effects of various frequencies on visual patterns and simulates their relative effects on DNA bases. By adjusting parameters such as frequency, DNA height, amplitude, and damping, users can explore the relationship between sound frequencies and visualizations for fun.

## Description

This project visualizes harmonic resonance patterns, known as Chladni patterns, and simulates their effects on DNA bases. By adjusting the frequency, DNA height, amplitude, and damping, users can see how different sound frequencies might influence visual patterns.

## Features

- **Frequency Control:** Adjust the frequency to see different Chladni patterns.
- **DNA Height Control:** Modify the height of the DNA helix to observe changes in pattern visualization.
- **Amplitude Control:** Change the amplitude to see how the intensity of the wave affects the patterns.
- **Damping Control:** Adjust the damping factor to see how quickly the patterns fade out.
- **Preset Buttons:** Quickly set common frequencies with descriptive labels.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the sliders to adjust the visualization parameters:
   - **Frequency:** Changes the sound frequency to display different Chladni patterns.
   - **DNA Height:** Alters the height of the DNA double helix visualization.
   - **Amplitude:** Adjusts the wave's amplitude.
   - **Damping:** Controls the rate at which the pattern fades.
3. Click the preset buttons to set common frequencies and observe their specific effects on the visual patterns.
