# Chladni Frequency Visualizer

A Chladni frequency visualizer using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript that shows the effect of frequencies on DNA bases.

_Note: This is not scientific. Its just for relative visualization._

## Description

This project visualizes harmonic resonance patterns, known as Chladni patterns, and their (relative) effects on DNA bases. By adjusting the frequency, DNA height, amplitude, and damping, users can explore how different sound frequencies influence the activation of DNA bases based on their wavelength.

## Features

- **Frequency Control:** Adjust the frequency to see different Chladni patterns.
- **DNA Height Control:** Modify the height of the DNA helix to observe changes in pattern activation.
- **Amplitude Control:** Change the amplitude to see how the intensity of the wave affects the patterns.
- **Damping Control:** Adjust the damping factor to see how quickly the patterns fade out.
- **Preset Buttons:** Quickly set common frequencies with descriptive labels.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the sliders to adjust the visualization parameters:
   - **Frequency:** Changes the sound frequency to display different Chladni patterns.
   - **DNA Height:** Alters the height of the DNA double helix.
   - **Amplitude:** Adjusts the wave's amplitude.
   - **Damping:** Controls the rate at which the pattern fades.
3. Click the preset buttons to set common frequencies and observe their specific effects on DNA bases.
